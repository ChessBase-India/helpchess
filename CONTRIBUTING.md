If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a
bug report and let us know!

- Documentation
- Issue Triage
- Web design

## Find an Issue

Try and look for an issue in the github issues tab, or create one if you want to add something or fix something.

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying
that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.

## How to contribute

- Fork the project and clone it to your local machine. Follow the installation guide, from README.
- Create a branch with your GitHub username and the ID of the issue, for example: git checkout -b USERNAME/some-new-feature-1234
- Code and commit your changes. Bonus points if you write a good commit message: git commit -m 'Add some feature'.
- Push to the branch: git push -u origin USERNAME/some-new-feature-1234
- Create a pull request for your branch. üéâ

## Contribution guidelines

- Create an issue
- Nobody's perfect. Something doesn't work? Something could be better? Check to see if the issue already exists, and if it does, leave a comment to get our attention! If the issue doesn't already exist, feel free to create a new one. A core team member will triage incoming issues.

Please note: core team members may update the title of an issue to reflect the discussion.

### Consider accessibility in UI changes

- If the change you're proposing touches a user interface, include accessibility in your approach. This includes things like color contrast, keyboard accessibility, screen reader labels, and other common requirements.

### Please use inclusive language

- Inclusion and respect are core tenets of our Code of Conduct. We expect thoughtful language all the way down to the code. Some technical metaphors are alienating or triggering. We ask that contributors go the extra mile to submit code which is inclusive in nature.

- If you unintentionally use language deemed harmful, there is no shame. We will work together to find a better alternative. Being thoughtful about language also encourages more thoughtful code!

### Create a pull request

- Try to keep the pull requests small. A pull request should try its very best to address only a single concern.
- For work in progress pull requests, please use the Draft PR feature.
- Document your reasoning behind the changes. Explain why you wrote the code in the way you did. The code should explain what it does.
- If there's an existing issue, reference to it by adding something like References/Closes/Fixes/Resolves #123, where 123 is the issue number. More info here.
- All commits in a pull request will be squashed when merged.
- Please note: a core team member may close your PR if it has gone stale or if we don't plan to merge the code.

### Pull request reviews

- All community pull requests are reviewed by our core team.
- Requested Changes must be resolved (with code or discussion) before merging.
- If you make changes to a PR, be sure to re-request a review.
- Style discussions are generally discouraged in PR reviews; make a PR to the linter configurations instead.
- Your code will be deployed shortly after it is merged.

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:

- The original github issue

## The bottom line

We are all humans trying to work together to improve the chess community. Always be kind and appreciate the need for tradeoffs. ‚ù§Ô∏è
